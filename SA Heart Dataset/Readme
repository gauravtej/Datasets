This dataset answers the following questions below - 
1. Find out the number cases available in the dataset for chd and no chd. Is it an imbalanced data- set for classification modelling? Plot the findings using a bar plot, where x is chd or no chd and y gives the count of samples in each group.
2. To create a balanced dataset, do upsampling of chd cases to be same as number of no chd cases. For upsampling, use resampling with replacement technique.
3. Maintain two datasets – imbalanced dataset (original one) and balanced dataset – using the upsam- pling approach. Split each of the datasets into 80:20 splits for creating training and test sets.
4. Build a logistic regression model using both the imbalanced and balanced datasets and com- pare results. Use K-fold cross-validation (k = 5) and ROC AUC score for comparing the model performance.
5. Build a Random Forest model using balanced dataset. Use grid search mechanism to find the most optimal values of the following parameters:
 n_estimators = [50, 100, 200, 500]
 max_depth = [3, 5, 7, 9]
 max_features = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
Find the best model based on ROC_AUC score.
6. Find features importance from the model built in Question 6 and report the top features which explain 95% of information or variance in the dataset.
7. Build a decision tree model using the features selected above and the following parameters:
 max_depth = 4
 Criterion = “entropy”
Interpret the rules generated by the decision tree. Explain how these rules can be used in the real
world.
