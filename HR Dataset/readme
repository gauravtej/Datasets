The dataset hr_data.csv contains samples of candidates that were part of a recruitment process of a par- ticular client of ScaleneWorks. ScaleneWorks supports several information technology (IT) companies in India with their talent acquisition. One of the challenge they face is about 30% of the candidates who accept the jobs offer, do not join the company. This leads to huge loss of revenue and time as the compa- nies initiate the recruitment process again to fill the workforce demand. ScaleneWorks wants to find out if a model can be built to predict the likelihood of a candidate joining the company. If the likelihood is high, then the company can go ahead and offer the jobs to the candidates.
The dataset contains several attributes about candidates along with a column (or variable) that indi- cates if the candidate finally joined the company or not.
Here is the description of candidate’s attributes:
� Candidate – Reference number; it is a unique number to identify the candidate
� DOJ extended – Binary variable identifying whether candidate asked for date of joining exten-
sion (Yes/No) 
� Duration to accept the offer – Number of days taken by the candidate to accept the offer (Scale
variable)
� Notice period – Notice period to be served in the parting company before candidate can join this
company (Scale variable)
� Offered band – Band offered to the candidate based on experience, performance in interview
rounds (C0/C1/C2/C3/C4/C5/C6) 
� Percentage hike expected – Percentage hike expected by the candidate (Scale variable)
� Percentage hike offered – Percentage hike offered by the company (Scale variable)
� Joiningbonus – Binary variable indicating if joining bonus was given or not (Yes/no) 
� Gender – Gender of the candidate (Male/Female) 
� Candidate source – Source from which resume of the candidate was obtained (Employee refer-
ral/Agency/ Direct)
� REX (in Yrs.) – Relevant years of experience of the candidate for the position offered (Scale variable)
� LOB – Line of business for which offer was rolled out (Categorical variable) 
� Date of Birth – Date of birth of the candidate
� Joining location – Company location for which the offer was rolled out for the candidate to join
(Categorical variable)
� Candidate relocation status – Binary variable indicating whether the candidate has to relocate
from one city to another city for joining (Yes/No) 
� HR Status – Final joining status of the candidate (Joined/Not Joined)
11. Build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a candidate joining the company. Assume “Not Joined” as positive cases and “Joined” as negative cases.
12. Find the significant features from the above model and build another logistic regression model with only the significant features.
13. Assume the following costs to find optimal cut-off probability to determine if a candidate will join or not.
� Cost of predicting “Not Joining” as “Joining” (FPs) cases is 3 times more than predicting “Joining” as “Not Joining” (FNs).
14. Buildaconfusionmatrixbasedonthecut-offprobabilityfoundinQuestion13andreporttheprecision and recall of the model for joining cases.
15. HR wants to understand the key parameters effecting the joining of candidates. So, build a decision tree with optimal parameters and provide some rules to HR for building strategies to ensure candi- dates offered job most likely will join the company in future.
